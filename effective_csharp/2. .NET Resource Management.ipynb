    "Two mechanisms help developers control the lifetimes of unmanaged resources: finalizers and the IDisposable interface. A finalizer is a defensive mechanism that ensures that your objects always have a way to release unmanaged resources. Finalizers have many drawbacks, so you also have the IDisposable interface that provides a less intrusive way to return resources to the system in a timely manner.\n",

Every time it gets called, you create another Font object that contains the exact same settings. The garbage collector needs to clean those up for you.

More allocations mean more pressure on the GC, causing it to run more often. That's incredibly inefficient.\n",
