    "Two mechanisms help developers control the lifetimes of unmanaged resources: finalizers and the IDisposable interface. A finalizer is a defensive mechanism that ensures that your objects always have a way to release unmanaged resources. Finalizers have many drawbacks, so you also have the IDisposable interface that provides a less intrusive way to return resources to the system in a timely manner."
